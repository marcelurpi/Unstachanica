# Unstachanica

A game about crafting spaceships with unstable materials (they vanish after a set number of seconds).
It requires startegy and fast decision making.
Made with Unity and C#.

Currently unstable and some of the features are not working but its just a prototype made in a few days for Jamcraft 5.
May be worked on in the future and the drawing is a sketch showing how it is supposed to look.
